    Recursively get paths to all markdown files in a directory

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : (str | None)
        The root directory to search. If None, defaults to the "content" folder in the
        working directory. This parameter is used internally for recursion and should
        initially be called with NoneÂ or excluded.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary mapping markdown page paths relative to the "content" directory
        to their absolute paths in the form of: { relative_path: absolute_path, ...}

        This may seem redundant at a first glance, but having the absolute paths as
        well aids greatly in producing the correct path links for local/dev builds
        where the absolute URL is not known

    Notes
    -----
    - README.md files are excluded.
    - Keys in the returned dictionary are paths relative to the "content" directory
